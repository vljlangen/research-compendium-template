# Research Compendium Template

This repository is an example template for organizing research projects. It is structured to help researchers store, analyze, and document their work in a standardized way, ensuring reproducibility and ease of collaboration.

## Repository Structure

- **analysis/**: Directory for storing analysis scripts. These scripts should be used to process and analyze the data.
  - `my_analysis.Rmd`: Example R Markdown script for analyzing the data. Replace or add your own scripts as needed.
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw data files. These files should remain unchanged after initial creation to preserve data integrity.
  - `my_data.csv`: Example data file in CSV format. Replace or add your own raw data files here.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, ensuring that unnecessary or sensitive files are not included in the repository. This `.gitignore` file is tailored for R projects and may need adjustment based on your specific needs.
- **DESCRIPTION**: Contains project metadata, including title, version, author, and a brief description of the project.
- **LICENSE**: Contains the licensing terms for this repository. This project is licensed under the MIT License. When you fork this repository, you may edit the `LICENSE` file as needed to reflect your own licensing preferences.
- **README.md**: Provides a top-level overview of the repository's contents and a guide for users.
